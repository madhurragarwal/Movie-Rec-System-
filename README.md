# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## Overview

This Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and other relevant factors. It employs a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations
- Hybrid recommendation algorithm
- User rating and review analysis
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains movie information, including titles, genres, directors, actors, and user ratings. The user data includes user IDs, movie IDs, and user ratings. The dataset used for this project is available at [link to dataset source].

## Recommendation Algorithms

The recommendation system employs a hybrid model, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate movie suggestions for users.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the system's performance using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The lower these metrics, the better the recommendations.
